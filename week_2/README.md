During this paper discussion session, we will cover the following topics:

- The motivation behind the ResNet architecture
- The architecture and its components
- The impact of the ResNet architecture on the field of computer vision

### The motivation behind the ResNet architecture

The ResNet paper was motivated by the problem of degradation in deep neural networks. The authors of the paper wanted to investigate whether increasing the depth of a neural network would always improve its performance on the ImageNet classification task, or if there was a limit beyond which the performance would start to degrade.

### The architecture and its components

The ResNet architecture is a deep convolutional neural network that consists of residual blocks, which allow the network to learn residual functions rather than directly learning the desired underlying mapping. This approach helps to mitigate the degradation problem and allows for the creation of even deeper neural networks.

During the paper discussion session, we will go over the architecture in detail, including its residual blocks and skip connections.

### The impact of the ResNet architecture on the field of computer vision

The ResNet architecture had a significant impact on the field of computer vision, both in terms of its performance on the ImageNet classification task and its influence on subsequent research. The ResNet architecture achieved state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet task in 2015, and its success inspired further research into deeper neural networks with skip connections.

During the paper discussion session, we will explore the impact of the ResNet architecture on the field of computer vision and discuss its lasting legacy.
